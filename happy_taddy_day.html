        <p class="message">I promise to stand by your side, through every joy and every storm, today and always. I promise that I will never get bored of you, never leave you alone in any situation, and always be your guiding light in the darkest of times. I promise to hold your hand when you're scared, to lift you up when you feel weak, and to walk beside you no matter where life takes us. I promise to never let you turn back, to never get tired of loving you, and to cherish every moment with you. And one day, our little chhotu bachhas will call me Dada and you Mamma, growing up in a world filled with love, laughter, and endless happiness. ðŸ’–ðŸ’«ðŸ’–</p>
